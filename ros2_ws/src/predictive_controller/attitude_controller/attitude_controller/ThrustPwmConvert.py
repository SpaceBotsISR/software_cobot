class ThrustPwmConvert: 
    '''
    This simple class will be used to have an easy interface in converting between thurst and pwm, since we only have acess to one model that converts
    for pwm (us) -> thrust (N), and we will need to make the oposite conversion from thrust -> pwm 
    '''
    def __init__(self, pwm_to_thrust_coefs : np.array, pwm_limits : list, engine_off_pwm : float = 1500.0):
        '''
        Constructor for the class

        Initializas the default values for the function, and stores the general solution we will need to use in the reverse conversion of the mode

        Parameters: 
            pwm_to_thrust_coefs - np.array : This is as ordered list with the coeficients of the polynomial that converts from pwm -> thrust. 
                                The coeficient should be ordered in crescent order, so [a b c], where thrust = a + b * pwm + c * pwm^(2). 
                                If a polynomial with an higher order is used, the same order should be applied, and the coeficients should be append at the end
            
            pwm_limits - list <float> : A list that tell us the range of values we are allowed to give as pwm, to make sure we are operating inse the correct values for the current model
                                        and to make sure we dont give a value that is out of bounds for waht the motor allows us

            engine_off_pwm - float :  The pwm we must give to turn the engine off, meaning no rotation, this will be given when we can product a value that is inside bounds for the desired thrust

        Returns
